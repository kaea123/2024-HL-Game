**** Instructions **** 

To begin, choose the number of rounds and either customise 
the game parameters or go with the default game (where the 
secret number will be between 1 and 100)

Then choose how many rounds you'd like to play <enter> for
infinite mode.

Your goal is to try guess the secret number without 
running out of guesses.

 Good luck.
